# What is asked to do...

I have created repo for assignments for you all
https://github.com/4alpha/assignment-2019

you need to create folder inside it and just add commit and push source code

do not push / commit large files like docker images, bin, video, images etc
only source code should be checked in it

your local structure could be like this
cloned copy will reside here /home/<username>/code/assignment-2019/

your individual folder will reside init
"/<username>/html etc"
