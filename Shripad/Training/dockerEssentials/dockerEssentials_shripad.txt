Finished Section 6 of Docker Essentials Course.
1. First Demo of Installing Docker Compose was quick. Just Downloading took more time then normal.
2. Second Demo about Structure of Compose file, I personally found helpful as you can always check for your system details like name, password, database name here.
3. For Lecture 38 : file name in the S6 directory was composs-docker.yaml which should be compose-docker.yaml So I renamed it with mv command. Still it didn't work. showing ERROR: Named volume "wordpress-files:/var/www/html:rw" is used in service "wordpress" but no declaration was found in the volumes section. Further Harshada Corrected the File and it worked.
4. While Running mysql as Client in docker run command it was showing error "Access denied" And Mistake was I typed spaces instead of underscore in $MYSQL
5. Quiz 6 : You got 4 out of 5 correct on the first attempt.
